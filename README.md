> A DaVinci Studio Video Converter for Linux


## Context
So due to stupid licensing laws, on Linux you can't get h264 codec without the studio version of DaVinci Studios. So my three options were...

- Pay $300 dollars to get the full version of DaVinci with the codec
- Dual boot windows 
- Spend hours of my short life making a converter that uses an ffmpeg command for converting

I chose the 3rd option

I will make this README better at some point i promise, i just wanted to make the tool a bit more presentable. However, if you want to run it now you can just clone this repo and run `./davinci-video-converter` **Make sure you have ffmpeg installed!**
