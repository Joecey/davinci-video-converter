# DaVinci Video Converter

## Context
So due to stupid licensing laws, on Linux you can't get h264 codec without the studio version of DaVinci Studios. So my three options were...

- Pay $300 dollars to get the full version of DaVinci with the codec
- Dual boot windows 
- Spend hours of my short life making a converter that uses an ffmpeg command for converting

I chose the 3rd option
